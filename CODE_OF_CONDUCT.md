Community Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language.

Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

Focusing on what is best for the community.

Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Scope

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
